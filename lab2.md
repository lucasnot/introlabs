2) It is important to choose a license for free software because licenses grant permissions for someone to use their creation. Using something such as the GNU General Public license or copy left, when redistributing software or programs, keeps the program free. Also, anything modified or extended from the original version of the program must also be free.

3) Someone should not use a project that does not have an explicit license because something such as copy left will more apply to the users. The Copy left method makes the program free. License that are permissive determine the requirements about how the software can be distributed. These licenses make no guarantee that the future iterations will remain free. 

4) I agree to the claim that because of the way that gopher was developed, it eventually lost to the Web development team. Gopher decided no to release the software to the users as often as the Web development team did, leading to the Web team getting improvements straight from the community, whereas the Gopher team burdened themselves. Lastly, Gopher decided they would have a licensing fee for any .com domain but not for the .edu domain. They lost many developers because of this.

5) Linux uses the GPL v2 license because Linux follows the principles of "free" software. Its users can modify and distribute the software, as well as use it for commercial uses. This exemplifies what linux and free software are for.

6) An example project would be an application for android that lets you know the status of the laundry machines in your dorm. Because I want it to be improved upon by anyone who wants to, I would use the GNU GPLv3 license. This would keep me from being liable about anything that people use it for

7) The license that would benefit a company the most would be the Apache License. It is a permissive software license that forces you to include copyright, but allows your to modify and distribute. Also, it has restrictions on trademarks. The MIT license can be used for Commercial or Private use. The best license for the user would be the GNU GPL v3 License. This is because, like the MIT license, it can be modified and distributed but unlike the MIT license, it has to include the original, it has to list the changes from the original, and it has to disclose its source. Lastly, the GNU License makes it so the owner cannot beheld liable. The best overall would be the MIT license. It lets you do basically what you'd like as long as you include the original license and copyright.
